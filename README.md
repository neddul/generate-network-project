# generate-network-project

This is a project for the project course (1DL507) at Uppsala university. 

Overall, we worked on generating synthetic population registry data for one year but also coherent data for multiple years. 

Furthermore, we created different layers for a social network based first on our synthetic data, but then also on the swedish registry data (SCB). 

We created the basis fo data creation and understanding of all variables together as a group. But overall the group was mainly divided the following way. 

Synthetic Data: Ludvig, (Xenia)
Family Layer: Inga
Work Layer: Ruvimbo
